            <h3>She Kills Monsters - Assistant Sound Designer</h3>
            <p>
                "She Kills Monsters tells the story of Agnes Evans 
                as she leaves her childhood home in Ohio following 
                the death of her teenage sister, Tilly. When Agnes 
                finds Tilly’s Dungeons & Dragons notebook, however, 
                she finds herself catapulted into a journey of discovery 
                and action-packed adventure in the imaginary world that was 
                her sister’s refuge. In this high-octane dramatic comedy 
                laden with homicidal fairies, nasty ogres, and 90s pop culture, 
                acclaimed playwright Qui Nguyen offers a heart-pounding homage 
                to the geek and warrior within us all" (November 8th-23rd 2024)

            <h3>Edith Can Shoot Things And Hit Them - Assistant Lights Designer</h3>
            <p>
                "Three kids – Kenny, his sister Edith, and their friend Benji 
                – are all but abandoned on a farm in remotest Middle America. 
                With little adult supervision, they feed and care for each other, 
                making up the rules as they go. But when Kenny’s and Benji’s relationship 
                becomes more than friendship, and Edith shoots something she really 
                shouldn’t shoot, the formerly indifferent outside world comes barging 
                in whether they want it to or not." (Febuary 12-2 2025)
