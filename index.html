        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My legal name is Frank Banich. I am a second year at GT, 
            and my major is Computational Media. My goal is to be a game designer. 
            I am involved with the video game development club,
            and I am currently working as a level designer on two games, and I'm currently
            working as a sound designer for Dramatech theater's upcomming production

            <h3>She Kills Monsters</h3>
            <p>
                "She Kills Monsters tells the story of Agnes Evans 
                as she leaves her childhood home in Ohio following 
                the death of her teenage sister, Tilly. When Agnes 
                finds Tilly’s Dungeons & Dragons notebook, however, 
                she finds herself catapulted into a journey of discovery 
                and action-packed adventure in the imaginary world that was 
                her sister’s refuge. In this high-octane dramatic comedy 
                laden with homicidal fairies, nasty ogres, and 90s pop culture, 
                acclaimed playwright Qui Nguyen offers a heart-pounding homage 
                to the geek and warrior within us all" (Opens November 8th 2024)
