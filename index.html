        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Frank Banich. I am a second year computational media major 
            at Georgia Tech, and an aspiring game designer. I have worked as 
            a game designer through VGDev club, and I am also involved
            in Dramatech, GT's student run theater, as a sound and lights designer.

            <h3>She Kills Monsters - Assistant Sound Designer</h3>
            <p>
                "She Kills Monsters tells the story of Agnes Evans 
                as she leaves her childhood home in Ohio following 
                the death of her teenage sister, Tilly. When Agnes 
                finds Tilly’s Dungeons & Dragons notebook, however, 
                she finds herself catapulted into a journey of discovery 
                and action-packed adventure in the imaginary world that was 
                her sister’s refuge. In this high-octane dramatic comedy 
                laden with homicidal fairies, nasty ogres, and 90s pop culture, 
                acclaimed playwright Qui Nguyen offers a heart-pounding homage 
                to the geek and warrior within us all" (November 8th-23rd 2024)
